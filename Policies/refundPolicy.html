                    <li>If you have opted for the Cash on Delivery (COD) service, we will issue you a store credit/money transfer to the account you have asked us to do. Store credit is the credit you can use for purchases on our website for any purchase of items equivalent to the price of the items you have returned.</li>
                    <li>This means that we guarantee and evaluate the payment you have made with us and will provide a refund service according to your needs.</li>

                    <li>Cancellations depend on whether your order has been shipped or not. Usually, this happens within 3-5 business days, so try to cancel your order at an early stage.</li>
                    <li>If your order has been shipped, we would not be able to cancel it. At that point, your next best option is to use our hassle-free return policy and return the item for a store credit.</li>
